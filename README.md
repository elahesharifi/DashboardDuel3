## 🔍 Key Insights
Developed in collaboration with **Helene Hinskens**, this dashboard utilizes **real-world data** to provide deep insights into student success.

### 1. Career Transition (Sankey Diagram)
A standout feature of this analysis is the visualization of how talent pivots from fields such as **Administration, Marketing, Logistics, and Research** into high-demand IT specializations including:
* **Web Development & Full Stack Development** (Largest talent pool).
* **Data Analytics & Data Science**.
* **Cybersecurity & UI/UX**.

### 2. Language Proficiency & Employment
* **English**: 75% of talents possess a C1/C2 level, making them highly suitable for international tech environments.
* **Dutch**: 50% of students are currently at A1 or A2 levels. This highlights a strategic opportunity for language development to boost success in the local Dutch market.

### 3. Top Tech Academies
The dashboard tracks the primary educational sources for TechMeUp talent, with **Ironhack** and **Le Wagon** leading as the top contributors of graduates.

## 🌍 Working with Real-World Data
Handling a live dataset required professional diligence and technical precision:
* **Data Cleaning**: Used Power Query to standardize career paths and academy data from diverse sources.
* **Privacy (GDPR)**: All data has been **anonymized** to protect student privacy while maintaining the integrity of the trends.
* **Data Storytelling**: Focused on creating a "Recruiter-ready" view to help stakeholders quickly identify talent clusters.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
Based on the data patterns identified, I propose the following strategies for TechMeUp:
1.  **🇳🇱 Dutch Language Support**: Given that 50% of students are at beginner Dutch levels, integrating tech-specific Dutch modules could accelerate local job placement.
2.  **🎯 Career Coaching for Switchers**: Since many students are transitioning from non-tech roles, targeted guidance on "Translating Non-Tech Experience" for IT resumes is essential.
3.  **🛠️ Skill-Market Alignment**: Leveraging high English proficiency to place candidates in international tech hubs within the Netherlands.
